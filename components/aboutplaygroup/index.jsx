              <p>Playgroup is designed to connect small groups of individuals through online interaction easily to help alleviate the pain of using game specific group finders.  No matter what the game is, users will easily be able to find other like-minded individuals to play their favorite games with. </p>
              <p>Other group finders can be shady and collect information about you that you wouldn't want getting out to the public.  Depending on the application, they may also use this data to track you across other applications made by other companies.  They do this by selling your data!</p>
              <p>This web application is designed to collect as little information as possible from its users and will not be providing any user data to other large corporations.  Our mission is to create a safe, non-invasive, free platform for people to find or create their own niche groups on.</p>
              <p>Our team has made design conscious decisions to reflect this such as avoiding using database services that automatically collect and analyze user data.  The only sata that we store is the data that is necessry to run the web application.</p>
