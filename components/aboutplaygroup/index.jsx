              <p>Playgroup is designed to connect small groups of individuals through online interaction easily to help alleviate the pain of using game specific group finders.  No matter what the game is, users will easily be able to find other like-minded individuals to play their favorite games with. </p>
              <p>This web application is designed to collect as little information as possible from its users and will not be providing any user data to other large corporations.  Our mission is to create a safe, non-invasive, free platform for people to find or create their own niche groups on.</p>
